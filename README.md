**Abstract**

Despite the Canadian Correctional Service's (CSC) efforts to reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous women in Canadian federal prisons, Indigenous women continued to receive the 'worst' risk assessment scores between 2012 to 2018. A serious consequence of race impacting an inmate's risk assessment score is that inmates with the 'worst' scores do not have access to reintegration opportunities and programs. Using data from the CSC and expanding on Globe and Mail journalist Tom Cardoso's original study on race and risk assement scores, I use multiple logistic regression models to explore the relationship between race and receiving low reintegration potential scores. The paper concludes that the CSC risk assessment scores are trapping Indigenous women in a cycle of trauma and crime by limiting their ability to recieve additional privilieges, find employment opportunities, and campaign for early release.
